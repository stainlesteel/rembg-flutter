# rembg-flutter

Remove a background, but with flutter.
## Usage
You press the 'Continue' file, select a photo, and get your result.
## Installation
### Binaries
There aren't binaries available for any operating system, as `flet build` fails to recognize the required packages for this app (on my system).
### Python 3.x
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install required packages `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the app with `flet run main.py`

## Contribution
You can contribute by building a package for your operating system (or Android), and add it to the GitHub repository.
